    """ Find high and low voltages of traces using histograms

    This function determines the high and low voltages of traces by binning them
    into 30 bins, and trying to discern two peaks.
    Useful for determining the threshold value for measuring a blip.

    If no two peaks can be discerned after all attempts, None is returned for
    each of the returned dict keys except DC_voltage.

    Args:
        traces: 2D array of acquisition traces
        plot: Whether to plot the histograms
        threshold_peak: Threshold for discerning a peak. Will be varied if too
            many/few peaks are found
        attempts: Maximum number of attempts for discerning two peaks.
            Each attempt the threshold_peak is decreased/increased depending on
            if too many/few peaks were found
        threshold_method: Method used to determine the threshold voltage.
            Allowed methods are:

            * **mean**: average of high and low voltage.
            * **{n}\*std_low**: n standard deviations above mean low voltage,
              where n is a float (ignore slash in raw docstring).
            * **{n}\*std_high**: n standard deviations below mean high voltage,
              where n is a float (ignore slash in raw docstring).
            * **config**: Use threshold method provided in
              ``config.analysis.threshold_method`` (``mean`` if not specified)

        min_voltage_difference: minimum difference between high and low voltage.
            If not satisfied, all results are None.
            Will try to retrieve from config.analysis.min_voltage_difference,
            else defaults to 0.3V
        threshold_requires_high_low: Whether or not both a high and low voltage
            must be discerned before returning a threshold voltage.
            If set to False and threshold_method is not ``mean``, a threshold
            voltage is always determined, even if no two voltage peaks can be
            discerned. In this situation, there usually aren't any blips, or the
            blips are too short-lived to have a proper high current.
            When the threshold_method is ``std_low`` (``std_high``), the top
            (bottom) 20% of voltages are scrapped to ensure any short-lived blips
            with a high (low) current aren't included.
            The average is then taken over the remaining 80% of voltages, which
            is then the average low (high) voltage.
            Default is True.
            Can be set by config.analysis.threshold_requires_high_low
        min_SNR: Minimum SNR between high and low voltages required to determine
            a threshold voltage (default None).

    Returns:
        Dict[str, Any]:
        * **low** (float): Mean low voltage, ``None`` if two peaks cannot be
          discerned
        * **high** (float): Mean high voltage, ``None`` if no two peaks cannot
          be discerned
        * **threshold_voltage** (float): Threshold voltage for a blip. If SNR is
          below ``min_SNR`` or no two peaks can be discerned, returns ``None``.
        * **voltage_difference** (float): Difference between low and high
          voltage. If not two peaks can be discerned, returns ``None``.
        * **DC_voltage** (float): Average voltage of traces.

    """ Analyse flipping between NMR states

    For each up_proportion array, it will count the number of flips
    (transition between high/low up proportion) for each sample.

    If more than one up_proportion array is passed, combined flipping events
    between each pair of states is also considered (i.e. one goes from low to
    high up proportion, the other from high to low). Furthermore, filtering is
    also performed where flips are only counted if the nuclear state remains in
    the subspace spanned by the pair of states for all samples.

    Args:
        up_proportions_arrs: 3D Arrays of up proportions, calculated from
            `analyse_traces`. Up proportion is the proportion of traces that
            contain blips. First and second dimensions are arbitrary (can be a
            singleton), third dimension is samples.
        threshold_up_proportion: Threshold for when an up_proportion is high
            enough to count the nucleus as being in that state (consistently
            able to flip the electron). Can also be a tuple with two elements,
            in which case the first is a lower threshold, below which we can
            say the nucleus is not in the state, and the second is an upper
            threshold . If any up proportion is not in that state, it is in an
            undefined state, and not counted for flipping. For any filtering
            on up_proportion pairs, the whole row is considered invalid (NaN).

    Returns:
        Dict[str, Any]:
        * **flips(_{idx})** (int): Flips between high/low up_proportion.
          If more than one up_proportion_arr is provided, a zero-based index is
          added to specify the up_proportion_array. If an up_proportion is
          between the lower and upper threshold, it is not counted.
        * **flip_probability(_{idx})** (float): proportion of flips compared to
          maximum flips (samples - 1). If more than one up_proportion_arr is
          provided, a zero-based index is added to specify the
          up_proportion_array.

        The following results are between neighbouring pairs of
        up_proportion_arrs (idx1-idx2\ == +-1), and are only returned if more
        than one up_proportion_arr is given:

        * **combined_flips_{idx1}{idx2}**: combined flipping events between
          up_proportion_arrs idx1 and idx2, where one of the
          up_proportions switches from high to low, and the other from
          low to high.
        * **combined_flip_probability_{idx1}{idx2}**: Flipping probability
          of the combined flipping events.

        Additionally, each of the above results will have another result with
        the same name, but prepended with ``filtered_``, and appended with
        ``_{idx1}{idx2}`` if not already present. Here, all the values are
        filtered out where the corresponding pair of up_proportion samples do
        not have exactly one high and one low for each sample. The values that
        do not satisfy the filter are set to np.nan.

        * **filtered_scans_{idx1}{idx2}**: 2D bool array, True if pair of
          up_proportion rows remain in subspace
