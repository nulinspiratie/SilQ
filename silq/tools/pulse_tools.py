    """
    This method can be used when generating a periodic signal with an AWG device. Given a frequency and duration of the
    desired signal, a general AWG can produce that signal by repeating one waveform (waveform_1) for a number of times
    (cycles) and ending with a second waveform (waveform_2). This is a practical way of generating periodic signals that
    are long in duration without using a lot of the available RAM of the AWG.

    Because of the finite sampling rate and restrictions on amount of sample points (which must generally be a multiple
    of a certain number), there will be an error in the period of the generated signal. This error goes down with the
    number of periods (n) that one cycle of the repeated waveform contains.

    This function calculates the minimum number n for which the error threshold is satisfied. Therefore minimizing the
    total amount of sample points that need to be stored by the AWG.

        Args:
            duration (float): duration of the signal in seconds
            frequency (float): frequency of the signal in Hz
            sampling_rate (float): the sampling rate of the waveform
            threshold (float): threshold in relative period error
            n_min (int): minimum number of signal periods that the waveform must contain
            n_max (int): maximum number of signal periods that a waveform can contain
            sample_points_multiple (int): the number of samples must be a multiple of

        Returns:
            (tuple):
                n (int):        number of signal periods that are in one cycle of the repeating waveform
                error (float):  relative error in the signal period
                samples (int):  number of samples in one cycle of the repeating waveform
