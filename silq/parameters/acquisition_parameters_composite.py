class ESRParameterComposite(AcquisitionParameterComposite):
    """Parameter for most pulse sequences involving electron spin resonance.

    This parameter can handle many of the simple pulse sequences involving ESR.
    It uses the `ESRPulseSequence`, which will generate a pulse sequence from
    settings (see parameters below).

    In general the pulse sequence is as follows:

    1. Perform any pre_pulses defined in ``ESRParameter.pre_pulses``.
    2. Perform stage pulse ``ESRParameter.ESR['stage_pulse']``.
       By default, this is the ``plunge`` pulse.
    3. Perform ESR pulse within plunge pulse, the delay from start of plunge
       pulse is defined in ``ESRParameter.ESR['pulse_delay']``.
    4. Perform read pulse ``ESRParameter.ESR['read_pulse']``.
    5. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each ESR pulse in
       ``ESRParameter.ESR['ESR_pulses']``, which by default contains single
       pulse ``ESRParameter.ESR['ESR_pulse']``.
    6. Perform empty-plunge-read sequence (EPR), but only if
       ``ESRParameter.EPR['enabled']`` is True.
       EPR pulses are defined in ``ESRParameter.EPR['pulses']``.
    7. Perform any post_pulses defined in ``ESRParameter.post_pulses``.

    A shorthand for using the default ESR pulse for multiple frequencies is by
    setting `ESRParameter.ESR_frequencies`. Settings this will create a copy
    of ESRParameter.ESR['ESR_pulse'] with the respective frequency.

    Examples:
        The following code measures two ESR frequencies and performs an EPR
        from which the contrast can be determined for each ESR frequency:

        >>> ESR_parameter = ESRParameter()
        >>> ESR_parameter.ESR['pulse_delay'] = 5e-3
        >>> ESR_parameter.ESR['stage_pulse'] = DCPulse['plunge']
        >>> ESR_parameter.ESR['ESR_pulse'] = FrequencyRampPulse('ESR_adiabatic')
        >>> ESR_parameter.ESR_frequencies = [39e9, 39.1e9]
        >>> ESR_parameter.EPR['enabled'] = True
        >>> ESR_parameter.pulse_sequence.generate()

        The total pulse sequence is plunge-read-plunge-read-empty-plunge-read
        with an ESR pulse in the first two plunge pulses, 5 ms after the start
        of the plunge pulse. The ESR pulses have different frequencies.

        **kwargs: Additional kwargs passed to `AcquisitionParameter`.

            This is optional and can be toggled in ``EPR['enabled']``.

            ``silq.config.properties``.
            See notes below for more info.
        save_traces (bool): Save acquired traces to disk.
            If the acquisition has been part of a measurement, the traces are
            stored in a subfolder of the corresponding data set.
            Otherwise, a new dataset is created.
        dataset (DataSet): Traces DataSet
        base_folder (str): Base folder in which to save traces. If not specified,
            and acquisition is part of a measurement, the base folder is the

            the default data folder
        subfolder (str): Subfolder within the base folder to save traces.

    Notes:
        - All pulse settings are copies of
          ``ESRParameter.pulse_sequence.pulse_settings``.
        - For given pulse settings, ``ESRParameter.pulse_sequence.generate``
          will recreate the pulse sequence from settings.

class NMRParameterComposite(AcquisitionParameterComposite):
    """ Parameter for most measurements involving an NMR pulse.

    This parameter can apply several NMR pulses, and also measure several ESR
    frequencies. It uses the `NMRPulseSequence`, which will generate a pulse
    sequence from settings (see parameters below).

    In general, the pulse sequence is as follows:

    1. Perform any pre_pulses defined in ``NMRParameter.pre_pulses``.
    2. Perform NMR sequence

       1. Perform stage pulse ``NMRParameter.NMR['stage_pulse']``.
          Default is 'empty' `DCPulse`.
       2. Perform NMR pulses within the stage pulse. The NMR pulses defined
          in ``NMRParameter.NMR['NMR_pulses']`` are applied successively.
          The delay after start of the stage pulse is
          ``NMRParameter.NMR['pre_delay']``, delays between NMR pulses is
          ``NMRParameter.NMR['inter_delay']``, and the delay after the final
          NMR pulse is ``NMRParameter.NMR['post_delay']``.

    3. Perform ESR sequence

       1. Perform stage pulse ``NMRParameter.ESR['stage_pulse']``.
          Default is 'plunge' `DCPulse`.
       2. Perform ESR pulse within stage pulse for first pulse in
          ``NMRParameter.ESR['ESR_pulses']``.
       3. Perform ``NMRParameter.ESR['read_pulse']``, and acquire trace.
       4. Repeat steps 1 - 3 for each ESR pulse. The different ESR pulses
          usually correspond to different ESR frequencies (see
          `NMRParameter`.ESR_frequencies).
       5. Repeat steps 1 - 4 for ``NMRParameter.ESR['shots_per_frequency']``
          This effectively interleaves the ESR pulses, which counters effects of
          the nucleus flipping within an acquisition.

    This acquisition is repeated ``NMRParameter.samples`` times. If the nucleus
    is in one of the states for which an ESR frequency is on resonance, a high
    ``up_proportion`` is measured, while for the other frequencies a low
    ``up_proportion`` is measured. By looking over successive samples and
    measuring how often the ``up_proportions`` switch between above/below
    ``NMRParameter.threshold_up_proportion``, nuclear flips can be measured
    (see `NMRParameter.analyse` and `analyse_flips`).

        EPR (dict): `PulseSequenceGenerator` settings for EPR. This is optional

        post_pulses (List[Pulse]): Pulses to place at the end of the sequence.
        pulse_sequence (PulseSequence): Pulse sequence used for acquisition.
        ESR_frequencies (List[float]): List of ESR frequencies to use. When set,

        samples (int): Number of acquisition samples
        results (dict): Results obtained after analysis of traces.
        t_skip (float): initial part of read trace to ignore for measuring

            ``silq.config.properties.t_skip``.
        t_read (float): duration of read trace to include for measuring blips.

        threshold_up_proportion (Union[float, Tuple[float, float]): threshold
            for up proportions needed to determine ESR pulse to be on-resonance.
            If tuple, first element is threshold below which ESR pulse is
            off-resonant, and second element is threshold above which ESR pulse
            is on-resonant. Useful for filtering of up proportions at boundary.
            Retrieved from
            ``silq.config.properties.threshold_up_proportion``.
        traces (dict): Acquisition traces segmented by pulse and acquisition
            label
        silent (bool): Print results after acquisition
        continuous (bool): If True, instruments keep running after acquisition.
            Useful if stopping/starting instruments takes a considerable amount
            of time.
        properties_attrs (List[str]): Attributes to match with
            ``silq.config.properties`` See notes below for more info.
        save_traces (bool): Save acquired traces to disk.
            If the acquisition has been part of a measurement, the traces are
            stored in a subfolder of the corresponding data set.
            Otherwise, a new dataset is created.
        dataset (DataSet): Traces DataSet
        base_folder (str): Base folder in which to save traces. If not specified,
            and acquisition is part of a measurement, the base folder is the
            folder of the measurement data set. Otherwise, the base folder is
            the default data folder
        subfolder (str): Subfolder within the base folder to save traces.

    Note:
        - The `NMRPulseSequence` does not have an empty-plunge-read (EPR)
          sequence, and therefore does not add a contrast or dark counts.
          Verifying that the system is in tune is therefore a little bit tricky.
