class ElectronReadoutPulseSequence(PulseSequenceGenerator):
    """`PulseSequenceGenerator` for electron spin resonance (ESR).

    This pulse sequence can handle many of the basic pulse sequences involving
    ESR. The pulse sequence is generated from its pulse settings attributes.

    In general the pulse sequence is as follows:

    1. Perform any pre_pulses defined in ``ESRPulseSequence.pre_pulses``.
    2. Perform stage pulse ``ESRPulseSequence.ESR['stage_pulse']``.
       By default, this is the ``plunge`` pulse.
    3. Perform ESR pulse within plunge pulse, the delay from start of plunge
       pulse is defined in ``ESRPulseSequence.ESR['pulse_delay']``.
    4. Perform read pulse ``ESRPulseSequence.ESR['read_pulse']``.
    5. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each ESR pulse in
       ``ESRPulseSequence.ESR['ESR_pulses']``, which by default contains single
       pulse ``ESRPulseSequence.ESR['ESR_pulse']``.
    6. Perform empty-plunge-read sequence (EPR), but only if
       ``ESRPulseSequence.EPR['enabled']`` is True.
       EPR pulses are defined in ``ESRPulseSequence.EPR['pulses']``.
    7. Perform any post_pulses defined in ``ESRPulseSequence.post_pulses``.

    Parameters:
        ESR (dict): Pulse settings for the ESR part of the pulse sequence.
            Contains the following items:

            * ``stage_pulse`` (Pulse): Stage pulse in which to perform ESR
              (e.g. plunge). Default is 'plunge `DCPulse`.
            * ``ESR_pulse`` (Pulse): Default ESR pulse to use.
              Default is 'ESR' ``SinePulse``.
            * ``ESR_pulses`` (List[Union[str, Pulse]]): List of ESR pulses to
              use. Can be strings, in which case the string should be an item in
              ``ESR`` whose value is a `Pulse`.
            * ``pulse_delay`` (float): ESR pulse delay after beginning of stage
              pulse. Default is 5 ms.
            * ``read_pulse`` (Pulse): Pulse after stage pulse for readout and
              initialization of electron. Default is 'read_initialize`
              `DCPulse`.

        EPR (dict): Pulse settings for the empty-plunge-read (EPR) part of the
            pulse sequence. This part is optional, and is used for non-ESR
            contast, and to measure dark counts and hence ESR contrast.
            Contains the following items:

            * ``enabled`` (bool): Enable EPR sequence.
            * ``pulses`` (List[Pulse]): List of pulses for EPR sequence.
              Default is ``empty``, ``plunge``, ``read_long`` `DCPulse`.

        pre_pulses (List[Pulse]): Pulses before main pulse sequence.
            Empty by default.
        post_pulses (List[Pulse]): Pulses after main pulse sequence.
            Empty by default.
        pulse_settings (dict): Dict containing all pulse settings.
        **kwargs: Additional kwargs to `PulseSequence`.

    Examples:
        The following code measures two ESR frequencies and performs an EPR
        from which the contrast can be determined for each ESR frequency:

        >>> ESR_pulse_sequence = ESRPulseSequence()
        >>> ESR_pulse_sequence.ESR['pulse_delay'] = 5e-3
        >>> ESR_pulse_sequence.ESR['stage_pulse'] = DCPulse['plunge']
        >>> ESR_pulse_sequence.ESR['ESR_pulse'] = FrequencyRampPulse('ESR_adiabatic')
        >>> ESR_pulse_sequence.ESR_frequencies = [39e9, 39.1e9]
        >>> ESR_pulse_sequence.EPR['enabled'] = True
        >>> ESR_pulse_sequence.pulse_sequence.generate()

        The total pulse sequence is plunge-read-plunge-read-empty-plunge-read
        with an ESR pulse in the first two plunge pulses, 5 ms after the start
        of the plunge pulse. The ESR pulses have different frequencies.

    Notes:
        For given pulse settings, `ESRPulseSequence.generate` will recreate the
        pulse sequence from settings.

       4. Repeat steps 1 - 3 for each ESR pulse. The different ESR pulses
          usually correspond to different ESR frequencies (see
          `NMRPulseSequence`.ESR_frequencies).
       5. Repeat steps 1 - 4 for ``NMRPulseSequence.ESR['shots_per_frequency']``
          This effectively interleaves the ESR pulses, which counters effects of
          the nucleus flipping within an acquisition.

    By measuring the average up proportion for each ESR frequency, a switching
    between high and low up proportion indicates a flipping of the nucleus

class ESRPulseSequence(PulseSequenceGenerator):
    """`PulseSequenceGenerator` for electron spin resonance (ESR).

    This pulse sequence can handle many of the basic pulse sequences involving
    ESR. The pulse sequence is generated from its pulse settings attributes.

    In general the pulse sequence is as follows:

    1. Perform any pre_pulses defined in ``ESRPulseSequence.pre_pulses``.
    2. Perform stage pulse ``ESRPulseSequence.ESR['stage_pulse']``.
       By default, this is the ``plunge`` pulse.
    3. Perform ESR pulse within plunge pulse, the delay from start of plunge
       pulse is defined in ``ESRPulseSequence.ESR['pulse_delay']``.
    4. Perform read pulse ``ESRPulseSequence.ESR['read_pulse']``.
    5. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each ESR pulse in
       ``ESRPulseSequence.ESR['ESR_pulses']``, which by default contains single
       pulse ``ESRPulseSequence.ESR['ESR_pulse']``.
    6. Perform empty-plunge-read sequence (EPR), but only if
       ``ESRPulseSequence.EPR['enabled']`` is True.
       EPR pulses are defined in ``ESRPulseSequence.EPR['pulses']``.
    7. Perform any post_pulses defined in ``ESRPulseSequence.post_pulses``.

    Parameters:
        ESR (dict): Pulse settings for the ESR part of the pulse sequence.
            Contains the following items:

            * ``stage_pulse`` (Pulse): Stage pulse in which to perform ESR
              (e.g. plunge). Default is 'plunge `DCPulse`.

            * ``ESR_pulses`` (List[Union[str, Pulse]]): List of ESR pulses to
              use. Can be strings, in which case the string should be an item in
              ``ESR`` whose value is a `Pulse`.
            * ``pulse_delay`` (float): ESR pulse delay after beginning of stage
              pulse. Default is 5 ms.
            * ``read_pulse`` (Pulse): Pulse after stage pulse for readout and
              initialization of electron. Default is 'read_initialize`
              `DCPulse`.

        EPR (dict): Pulse settings for the empty-plunge-read (EPR) part of the
            pulse sequence. This part is optional, and is used for non-ESR
            contast, and to measure dark counts and hence ESR contrast.
            Contains the following items:

            * ``enabled`` (bool): Enable EPR sequence.
            * ``pulses`` (List[Pulse]): List of pulses for EPR sequence.
              Default is ``empty``, ``plunge``, ``read_long`` `DCPulse`.

            Empty by default.
        pulse_settings (dict): Dict containing all pulse settings.
        **kwargs: Additional kwargs to `PulseSequence`.

    Examples:
        The following code measures two ESR frequencies and performs an EPR
        from which the contrast can be determined for each ESR frequency:

        >>> ESR_pulse_sequence = ESRPulseSequence()
        >>> ESR_pulse_sequence.ESR['pulse_delay'] = 5e-3
        >>> ESR_pulse_sequence.ESR['stage_pulse'] = DCPulse['plunge']
        >>> ESR_pulse_sequence.ESR['ESR_pulse'] = FrequencyRampPulse('ESR_adiabatic')
        >>> ESR_pulse_sequence.ESR_frequencies = [39e9, 39.1e9]
        >>> ESR_pulse_sequence.EPR['enabled'] = True
        >>> ESR_pulse_sequence.pulse_sequence.generate()

        The total pulse sequence is plunge-read-plunge-read-empty-plunge-read
        with an ESR pulse in the first two plunge pulses, 5 ms after the start
        of the plunge pulse. The ESR pulses have different frequencies.

class NMRPulseSequence(PulseSequenceGenerator):
    """`PulseSequenceGenerator` for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).

    This pulse sequence can handle many of the basic pulse sequences involving
    NMR. The pulse sequence is generated from its pulse settings attributes.

    In general, the pulse sequence is as follows:

    1. Perform any pre_pulses defined in ``NMRPulseSequence.pre_pulses``.
    2. Perform NMR sequence

       1. Perform stage pulse ``NMRPulseSequence.NMR['stage_pulse']``.
          Default is 'empty' `DCPulse`.
       2. Perform NMR pulses within the stage pulse. The NMR pulses defined
          in ``NMRPulseSequence.NMR['NMR_pulses']`` are applied successively.
          The delay after start of the stage pulse is
          ``NMRPulseSequence.NMR['pre_delay']``, delays between NMR pulses is
          ``NMRPulseSequence.NMR['inter_delay']``, and the delay after the final
          NMR pulse is ``NMRPulseSequence.NMR['post_delay']``.

    3. Perform ESR sequence

       1. Perform stage pulse ``NMRPulseSequence.ESR['stage_pulse']``.
          Default is 'plunge' `DCPulse`.
       2. Perform ESR pulse within stage pulse for first pulse in
          ``NMRPulseSequence.ESR['ESR_pulses']``.
       3. Perform ``NMRPulseSequence.ESR['read_pulse']``, and acquire trace.
       4. Repeat steps 1 - 3 for each ESR pulse. The different ESR pulses
          usually correspond to different ESR frequencies (see
          `NMRPulseSequence`.ESR_frequencies).
       5. Repeat steps 1 - 4 for ``NMRPulseSequence.ESR['shots_per_frequency']``
          This effectively interleaves the ESR pulses, which counters effects of
          the nucleus flipping within an acquisition.

    By measuring the average up proportion for each ESR frequency, a switching
    between high and low up proportion indicates a flipping of the nucleus

class NMRCPMGPulseSequence(NMRPulseSequence):
    """`PulseSequenceGenerator` for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).

    This pulse sequence can handle many of the basic pulse sequences involving
    NMR. The pulse sequence is generated from its pulse settings attributes.

    In general, the pulse sequence is as follows:

    1. Perform any pre_pulses defined in ``NMRPulseSequence.pre_pulses``.
    2. Perform NMR sequence

       1. Perform stage pulse ``NMRPulseSequence.NMR['stage_pulse']``.
          Default is 'empty' `DCPulse`.
       2. Perform NMR pulses within the stage pulse. The NMR pulses defined
          in ``NMRPulseSequence.NMR['NMR_pulses']`` are applied successively.
          The delay after start of the stage pulse is
          ``NMRPulseSequence.NMR['pre_delay']``, delays between NMR pulses is
          ``NMRPulseSequence.NMR['inter_delay']``, and the delay after the final
          NMR pulse is ``NMRPulseSequence.NMR['post_delay']``.

    3. Perform ESR sequence

       1. Perform stage pulse ``NMRPulseSequence.ESR['stage_pulse']``.
          Default is 'plunge' `DCPulse`.
       2. Perform ESR pulse within stage pulse for first pulse in
          ``NMRPulseSequence.ESR['ESR_pulses']``.
       3. Perform ``NMRPulseSequence.ESR['read_pulse']``, and acquire trace.
       4. Repeat steps 1 - 3 for each ESR pulse. The different ESR pulses
          usually correspond to different ESR frequencies (see
          `NMRPulseSequence`.ESR_frequencies).
       5. Repeat steps 1 - 4 for ``NMRPulseSequence.ESR['shots_per_frequency']``
          This effectively interleaves the ESR pulses, which counters effects of
          the nucleus flipping within an acquisition.

    By measuring the average up proportion for each ESR frequency, a switching
    between high and low up proportion indicates a flipping of the nucleus

class FlipFlopPulseSequence(PulseSequenceGenerator):
    """`PulseSequenceGenerator` for hitting the flip-flop transition

    The flip-flop transition is the one where both the electron and nucleus flip
    in opposite direction, thus keeping the total spin constant.

    This pulse sequence is mainly used to flip the nucleus to a certain state
    without having to perform NMR or even having to measure the electron.

    The flip-flop transitions between a nuclear spin state S1 and (S1+1) is:

    f_ESR(S1) + A/2 + gamma_n * B_0,

    where f_ESR(S1) is the ESR frequency for nuclear state S1, A is the
    hyperfine, gamma_n is the nuclear Zeeman, and B_0 is the static magnetic
    field. The transition will flip (electron down, nucleus S+1) to
    (electron up, nucleus S) and vice versa.

    Parameters:
        ESR (dict): Pulse settings for the ESR part of the pulse sequence.
            Contains the following items:

            * ``frequency`` (float): ESR frequency below the flip-flop
              transition (Hz).
            * ``hyperfine`` (float): Hyperfine interaction (Hz).
            * ``nuclear_zeeman`` (float): Nuclear zeeman strength (gamma_n*B_0)
            * ``stage_pulse`` (Pulse): Stage pulse in which to perform ESR
              (e.g. plunge). Default is `DCPulse`('plunge').
            * ``pre_flip_ESR_pulse`` (Pulse): ESR pulse to use before the
              flip-flop pulse to pre-flip the electron to spin-up,
              which allows the nucleus to be flipped to a higher state.
              Default is `SinePulse`('ESR').
            * ``flip_flop_pulse`` (Pulse): Flip-flop ESR pulse, whose
              frequency will be set to A/2 + gamma_n*B_0 higher than the
              ``frequency`` setting. Default pulse is `SinePulse`('ESR')
            * ``pre_flip`` (bool): Whether to pre-flip the electron, to
              transition to a higher nuclear state. Default is False.
            * ``pre_delay`` (float): Delay between start of stage pulse and
              first pulse (``pre_flip_ESR_pulse`` or ``flip_flop_pulse``).
            * ``inter_delay`` (float): Delay between ``pre_flip_ESR_pulse`` and
              ``flip_flop_pulse``. Ignored if pre_flip is False
            * ``post_delay`` (float): Delay after last frequency pulse and end
              of stage pulse.

        pre_pulses (List[Pulse]): Pulses before main pulse sequence.
            Empty by default.
