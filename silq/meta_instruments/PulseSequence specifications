PulseSequence
=============

The PulseSequence is a class that encompasses Pulses, and is able to define a
 measurement. Its current features are as follows:

Current features
================
- Ability to add/remove/address pulses
- Fixed total duration, determined from the pulses it contains
- Handle enabling/disabling of inidividual pulses
- Restrictions on adding (un)targeted pulses
- Find pulse(s) based on certain pulse or connection properties
- Find connection based on certain pulse or connection properties
- Check if pulses overlap
- Get transition voltage between two pulses (useful for triggering)


Desired features
================
That being said, it currently lacks some useful features, and
 is in need of an upgrade

PulseSequence within another PulseSequence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ability to add a PulseSequence as part of another PulseSequence allows a
natural way to break up a complex measurement into different layers.
For example, the entire measurement could be a Measurement PulseSequence,
which consists of three stages:

- Initialization - Perform the necessary pulses to initialize the system
- Manipulation - Manipulate the qubit through pulses
- Read - Read out the state of the qubit

Each of these stages could be an independent PulseSequence, which are joined
together in the larger PulseSequence. If you combine this with the idea of
registering a PulseSequence in the config, it becomes especially useful. For
instance, the Read stage can be identical for different measurements, and so
you only have to program the Read PulseSequence once, and it can then be
called from all measurements.

Issues
******
One of the issues is that of targeting. 


Loop over pulses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are situations when you want to loop over a pulse, or perhaps even a
PulseSequence. An example is the CPMG sequence, which consists of many
identical pi pulses. Instead of having to add 8192 pi-pulses to a
PulseSequence, which can significantly slow down the measurement, it is much
easier to add a single pulse with a command to apply it a number of times.
This idea could be extended to also iteratively modifying an attribute of the
Pulse being looped.
