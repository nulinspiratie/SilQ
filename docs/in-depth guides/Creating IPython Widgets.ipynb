    "# Creating IPython Widgets (IPywidgets)\n",
    "**ipywidgets is a Python package that can be installed using `pip install ipywidgets`.  \n",
    "Be sure to have the latest version of ipywidgets (at least 7.0).**\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "IPython widgets can be used to enhance the interactivity of Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "They allow adding GUI-like elements, such as buttons, textboxes, tabs, that can be linked to Python code execution.\n",
    "Widgets can be further linked to Javascript code, an important feature as it allows modification of the Javascript front-end.\n",
    "This enables:\n",
    "- Adding new elements using Javascript.\n",
    "- Cell manipulation (creating/deleting/moving/executing cells)\n",
    "- Linking keyboard shortcuts to code execution\n",
    "- Changing/adding CSS to change the page style\n",
    "\n",
    "IPywidgets can be used to create very interesting interactive features. As an example, one could create a sidebar with buttons that, when pressed, execute specific notebook cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information, please read:\n",
    "- IPywidgets documentation: https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/. In particular:\n",
    "    - List of standard IPywidgets: https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Widget%20List.html\n",
    "    - IPywidget interaction with Javascript: https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Widget%20Custom.html\n",
    "- Jupyter notebook extensions https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions\n",
    "    These extensions are written in Javascript, and so the code can also be used for IPywidgets.\n",
    "    The big difference is that a notebook extension is always executed when a notebook starts (if it's enabled), while an IPywidget needs to be created in Python. Furthermore, an extension is limited to Javascript, but an IPywidget can have both Python and Javascript, and can interact between the two. \n",
    "    It contains many good examples; for a good overview, install https://github.com/Jupyter-contrib/jupyter_nbextensions_configurator\n",
    "- QCoDeS used to have widgets as well, which showed an interesting way of using them.  Check version 1.3 (hash fb3c964c8c64cc81af6e9dee181ba0b3ab45a0c0)\n"
