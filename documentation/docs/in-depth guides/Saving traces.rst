Saving traces
*************
When performing an acquisition through the `AcquisitionParameter` using the
measurement `Loop`, the returned data has already been processed from the
measured traces.
It can be desired to also store the raw traces, and this feature is provided
by setting

>>> acquisition_parameter.save_traces = True

A single HDF5 file is created to store all the traces generated by the
`AcquisitionParameter` during the entire measurement `Loop`.
If a `Loop` contains multiple `AcquisitionParameters` with ``save_traces =
True``, a separate file is created for each one.

For a given ``dataset`` generated by the loop, the traces can be loaded using

>>> dataset.load_traces()

which uses the python package ``h5py``.

.. note::
   Depending on the measurement performed, a traces HDF5 file can quickly become
   too large to fully load into the memory. ``h5py`` allows parts of the full
   array to be loaded using slicing, see their documentation for details.
