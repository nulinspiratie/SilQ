Setting up QCoDeS and SilQ
##########################

.. note::
  Our group uses a `QCoDeS <https://github.com/QCoDeS/qcodes>`_ fork, which
  contains some modifications, mostly for compatibility with SilQ. Please make
  sure that the main QCoDeS fork is not installed (neither through GitHub nor
  ``pip``).

==============
Install Python
==============
Both QCoDeS and SilQ are written in Python. To use either, Python must first be
installed. We recomend using Anaconda, which is a Python installation that comes
with many packages including Jupyter Notebook, as well as the Spyder IDE.
Anaconda can be downloaded and installed as follows:

1. Download `Anaconda 64bit python 3.6 <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_.
2. Install Anaconda (make sure to tick the options add to system path and
   register as python 3.6).

==============
Install Github
==============
GitHub is used as a source control repository for QCoDeS and SilQ. This means
that the source code, as well as the latest developer versions can be downloaded
using GitHub. The following instructions download GitHub Desktop, which is a
basic GUI for managing GitHub repositories.

1. Download and install `Github Desktop <https://desktop.github.com/>`_ and
   create a `Github account <https://github.com/>`_.
2. Give Serwan your account details to add you to the private git repository
   for `SilQ <https://github.com/nulinspiratie/silq>`_ (which includes our
   group's fork of `QCoDeS <https://github.com/nulinspiratie/qcodes>`_).

.. note::
  Any modifications of the SilQ/QCoDeS source code should be uploaded using
  Pull Requests in GitHub.

.. note::
  It is not necessary to use GitHub Desktop. A good alternative is SourceTree
  by Atlassian, which has more functionality, but is also harder to get started.

.. todo::
  Make ``Pull requests`` a link.

=======================
Install QCoDeS and SilQ
=======================

--------------------
Download source code
--------------------
.. warning::
  Ensure QCoDeS is not installed on your computer and follow below instructions
  in correct order.

QCoDeS and SilQ should be installed from the source code. The source code can be
downloaded from GitHub using GitHub Desktop by cloning the repository
`SilQ <https://github.com/nulinspiratie/SilQ>`_ into your hard drive (e.g.
``User/Documents/Github/SilQ``).

.. note::
  The QCoDeS fork our group uses is a submodule of SilQ, and should be a folder
  in the ``SilQ`` folder. Please check that the folder is not empty, and if it
  is, download the source code of the submodules.

.. todo::
  Find correct command for downloading submodules (``git submodule init``?).

--------------
Install QCodes
--------------
To install our the QCoDeS fork of our group, follow these steps:

1. Open command prompt (type cmd into start menu and right click to open as
  administrator)
2. Navigate to the Qcodes folder on your computer (SilQ/Qcodes),
3. run ``python setup.py develop``
4. If a notification pops up that packages are missing, install these:
  Run ``pip install {packages}``, where ``{packages}`` are the packages you
  want to install separated by spaces.

------------
Install SilQ
------------
After QCoDeS is installed, similar directions should be used to install SilQ:

1. Open Command prompt.
2. Navigate to SilQ folder on your computer (not SilQ/silq but one level up).
3. Run ``python setup.py develop``.
4. Install any packages that are missing.

========================
Setup Experiments folder
========================

---------------
From repository
---------------
We store our group experiments in the GitHub repository Experiments, which includes our configurations and notebooks, but not our data.
1. Clone the repository `Experiments <https://github.com/nulinspiratie/experiments>`_ into your hard drive.
2. Point SilQ to you experiments repository by typing::

  import silq
  silq.set_experiments_folder(r'{experiments_folder}')

where you should replace `{experiments_folder}` with the absolute path to your Experiments folder.
Note that you should write the path as a raw string: `r'{experiments_folder}'`.

==========
Using SilQ
==========
The measurement software SilQ and QCodes can be imported as a package, just like any other python packages.
To use the measurement software in your script, use the following line::

  import qcodes as qc
  import silq

============
Using GitHub
============
1.	Commit your changes to the master branch including a meaningful heading and commentary
2.	Sync with the master branch to get other peopleâ€™s changes

==============
Install an IDE
==============
*******
PyCharm
*******
1.	Download, install, and open PyCharm Community Edition (or use the professional version which is free for students)
2.	Open SilQ project
3.	Go to file -> default settings -> project interpreter
4.	Set interpreter to the newly installed Python Anaconda 3.5
5.	Restart PyCharm

When using PyCharm, code must be executed in scripts. To run QCoDeS, write your commands after `if __name__ == "__main__":`

****************
Jupyter Notebook
****************
should be already installed alongside Anaconda Python

============================
Creating initialization code
============================
An experimental setup (or personal computer) often requires code that should be initialized at the start of your measurement session.
This includes loading often-used packages, initializing instruments, setting up the Layout, etc.
In SilQ this can be done by creating a list of initialization files that can easily be run.
If the initialization belongs to a measurement, the correct folder is `experiments\{experiment_name}\init`, while for personal initialization code the correct folder is `personal\{username}\{whatever_you_prefer}`.
It is recommended that you create separate files for distinct types of initialization code (e.g. package imports, instruments).
The files will be run in alphabetical order, so it is useful to add a numerical prefix to indicate the loading order.

Furthermore, you should add a label to ``silq\configurations.py``, with information on the location of the initialization folder.
You can also add additional ``modes``, which can for instance ignore some of the files (useful when you want to operate in `analysis` mode, etc.).
Once the initialization code has been written and a label has been assigned, you can run the initialization code using::

  import silq
  silq.initialize({label}, mode={mode})

where mode is optional.

=====================
Adding new interfaces
=====================
Adding a new instrument interface involves changing a handful of existing files and creating some necessary new files.
This section gives a quick overview on how to add a new (empty) interface.

-----------------------
Changing existing files
-----------------------
``silq/instrument_interfaces/__init__.py``

Add a new line for importing the new interface class::

  from .<company>.<model>_interface import <model>Interface

Add a new entry in the `instrument_interfaces` dictionary::

  '<instrument_class_name>': <model>Interface,

This connects the new interface to the corresponding Qcodes driver of the instrument

------------------
Creating new files
------------------
The following files need to be created::

# ``silq/instrument_interfaces/<company>/<model>_interface.py``

This is the main file containing most of the interface functionality. This file should contain a class specific for `<model>` called `<model>Interface` which inherits from `InstrumentInterface` and should implement all abstract methods.

# ``silq/instrument_interfaces/<company>/__init__.py``

This file is used for importing (possibly multiple) interface(s) of a specific company. Add a new line to do so::

  from .<model>_interface import <model>Interface
