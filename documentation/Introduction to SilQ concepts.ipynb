    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "SilQ is a measurement software package that is developed by the Morello group in Sydney.\n",
    "It utilizes the [QCoDeS measurement software](https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes), and provides added functionality and layers of complexity.\n",
    "While the actual measurement code is specific to the Morello group, most of SilQ is kept general and should be usable by other groups with minimal modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of SilQ is the `Layout` architecture, which translates setup-independent generic measurement code to setup-specific Instrument instructions (see image below).\n",
    "The `Layout` is a meta-instrument that has information about the experimental setup. \n",
    "This includes `Instruments` and the physical connectivity between them.\n",
    "Given a `PulseSequence` with `Pulses` (which are completely setup-independent), the `Layout` can determine which `Instrument` should output each `Pulse`, and distribute them accordingly.\n",
    "Once distributed, each `Instrument` should be programmed such that it outputs/measures the pulses that it has been given.\n",
    "This is done by adding an intermediate `Interface` for each `Instrument`.\n",
    "The `Interface` is used to translate these generic pulses into instructions specific to its `Instrument`.\n",
    "The `Interface` also reports back to the `Layout` if additional pulses, such as triggering pulses, are necessary, which the `Layout` then passes along to its triggering `Instrument`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this architecture, measurement code can be written that is setup-independent, and can therefore be used in completely different setups without requiring any modifications.\n",
    "This also greatly simplifies rewiring the setup, or replacing an instrument by another.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the functionality of the Layout architecture, we create a mock setup (shown below) that consists of three instruments:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An acquisition instrument\n",
    "2. A arbitrary waveform generator (AWG)\n",
    "3. A triggering instrument that triggers the waveform generator\n",
    "\n",
    "We then create a Layout that connects these instruments, and show that a generic `PulseSequence` can be converted to an actual measurement. \n",
    "\n",
    "The bottom of this notebook shows additional information about all the different classes.\n",

    "Each `Instrument` has a corresponding `Interface`, which performs the translation from instructions given by the `Layout` to actual instructions to the `Instruments`.\n",
    "As an example, the `Layout` calls `Interface.setup`, after which the `Interface` should use the pulses in its `Interface.pulse_sequence`, and convert it to commands to set up the underlying `Instrument`.\n",

    "This section sets up the dummy instruments and creates associated interfaces for each of the three instruments.\n",

    "This concludes our introduction to the Layout architecture.\n",
    "We have shown how interfaces can be created for the different instruments, and how they can be connected through the Layout.\n",
    "A setup-independent PulseSequence was then given to the Layout, which distributed the pulses to the experimental setup and configured the Instruments through their interfaces such the the resulting signal correctly measured the two sinusoidal waves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this architecture, measurement code can be written that is more generic.\n",
    "This enables use of the same measurement code in completely different setups.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional information\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interface\n",
    "- Interfaces are initialized by passing along the name of the underlying instrument.\n",
    "- `Interface.channels` contains all the channels of its Instrument. This is used when creating connections between interfaces through the Layout. Channels can have properties, such as whether it is an `input`, `output` `trigger` channel etc.\n",
    "- An `Interface` has both an `input_pulse_sequence` and an (output) `pulse_sequence`. The `input_pulse_sequence` contains all the pulses it receives from other Instruments, while the `pulse_sequence` contains pulses it outputs to other instruments. Both are parameters, as this ensures that it is saved during snapshots and is compatible with the multiprocessing architecture. Due to this constraint, performing operations such as adding a pulse requires passing a tuple ('add', {pulse}). See `Interface._set_pulse_sequence` for more info.\n",
    "- The attribute `Interface.instrument` contains the underlying instrument of the interface\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pulse implementation\n",
    "A `PulseImplementation` is meant to implement a generic pulse for a specific `Instrument`.\n",
    "Each `PulseImplementation` is specific to a certain `Pulse`, and is a child of both the `Pulse` it implements, as well as the base `PulseImplementation` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `PulseImplementation` generally has three main stages:\n",
    "- `__init__`: Initialize the parent class `PulseImplementation`. Initialization is only done for `Interface.pulse_implementation`, such that it has a list of all pulse implementations (see below). Note that it does not initialize the `Pulse` class, and therefore does not have the same properties as the `Pulse`. \n",
    "- `target_pulse`: Receives a pulse, and tailors the implementation to that specific pulse. The `PulseImplementation` now looks nearly identical to the untargeted pulse, except that it also has an implementation for a specific Instrument\n",
    "- `implement`: This function is called during `Interface.setup`, and implements the pulse for a specific `Instrument`. This stage is highly specific for each Instrument; in some cases, Interfaces need more of the `Instrument` configuration in `Interface.setup`, while others need most configuration in `Pulseimplementation.setup`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Interface.pulse_implementations` is a list containing `PulseImplementations`. This is used for two reasons\n",
    "  - Converting an abstract pulse to targeted instructions for the underlying Instrument. \n",
    "    As Instruments are setup in different ways, it should be decided per Instrument how to use a PulseImplementation to perform this conversion (look in existing Interfaces for examples).\n",
    "  - As a means for the Layout to determine which Instrument a pulse should be directed to. \n",
    "    A Layout usually receives abstract pulses containing no information about actual Instruments.\n",
    "    When the Layout targets an abstract pulse sequence, it checks for each pulse which interface can implement the given pulse.\n",
    "    It does so by looking at its pulse_implementations.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Layout\n",
    "- The Layout should be created after all Interfaces are created, as it receives the Interfaces as an argument during initialization.\n",
    "- Interfaces that have no pulse sequence after targeting of PulseSequence are not taken into account during setup, start, and stop\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connections\n",
    "- Connections are defined through `Layout.add_connection`. By default, a `Connection` is a `SingleConnections`, which refer to the connection being a single physical connection.\n",
    "- Several `SingleConnections` can be combined using `Layout.combine_connections`, resulting in a `CombinedConnection`. This is useful in cases where pulses always need to be sent through multiple connections simultaneously (such as when using compensated pulses).\n",
    "- When a Layout finds multiple connections that can implement the same pulse, it will check if any of them have the property`default=True`. If so, it will send the pulse to that connection. This may not be the optimal solution, and is subject to change.\n",
    "- Connections can have a scale, which accounts for attenuation in the cable. The 'CombinedConnection' also has a scale, which determines the compensation factor.\n",
    "- The user generally does not touch Connections. This is done internally by the Layout and Interfaces"
